        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Carat Live</strong> began as a bold vision to redefine how
          fans connect with their favorite artists. What started as a simple
          idea to make concert tickets more accessible quickly grew into a
          platform that has brought millions of fans closer to the artists they
          love. In the early days, it wasn’t just about selling tickets — it was
          about crafting an experience that made every fan feel like a VIP.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our breakthrough came when we partnered with some of the biggest names
          in the music industry, including global K-pop superstars
          <strong>Seventeen</strong> and <strong>Blackpink</strong>. These
          collaborations catapulted Carat Live into the spotlight, and fans from
          all over the world trusted us to deliver the best seats for sold-out
          shows. As our platform expanded, we embraced diverse genres, adding
          <strong>LANY's</strong> indie-pop magic and
          <strong>Brunos Mars's</strong> dazzling performances and the iconic
          <strong>Coldplay</strong>, whose immersive and electrifying live shows
          unite fans from every corner of the world. From the beginning, the
          focus has been on providing a reliable, fast, and user-friendly
          platform to help music lovers get closer to their favorite artists
          with just a few clicks. At Carat Live, we're proud to handle ticketing
          for some of the most iconic artists in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what truly set Carat Live apart was our commitment to innovation.
          We introduced cutting-edge technologies that made ticket purchasing
          smoother and faster. Fans no longer had to worry about missing out on
          tickets, and we created personalized experiences that let users feel
          connected to their favorite artists beyond just the concert.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Carat Live stands as more than just a ticketing service; it's a
          gateway to unforgettable memories, a platform where every fan’s
          journey to their dream concert begins. With each event we handle,
          we’re not just selling tickets — we’re building a legacy of incredible
          live music experiences.
